# Speed Click - Unity 3D Client

This is a simple 2D game which I developed in 2013 when learning Unity 3D with some videos on youtube. It's far from completed xD

You can create an account or play anonymously. In order to submit your scores, you need to be logged in.

### Objective

There are some existing stages, you may select any of your choice.

You'll be presented with some images. One of them will be displayed on the top of your screen. The idea is to click in one of the
images below as fast as possible. As soon as you click, another image is randomly picked so you can select the correct one again.

You'll have a predefined amount of time to click on the correct images the fastest you can.

If you click the correct image, you earn points. However, if you pick the wrong image, you'll lose part of you remaining time,
as well as points.

Each stage has different images, different times and the drain for clicking the wrong image is different as well.

### Ranking System

There is a ranking for each stage. You may retry as many times as you want, but only your best score is stored at the moment.

### Tech

I used Unity 3D with C# code to design it. It stores/gets data from an API whose code is in another repository.

The API was done with C# ASP.NET MVC.
